    <h2>by Neil Young</h2>

    <h3>Lyrics:</h3>

    <p>
      Come a little bit closer <br />
      Hear what I have to say <br />
      Just like children sleepin'<br />
      We could dream this night away<br />
<br>
      But there's a full moon risin'<br />
      Let's go dancin' in the light <br />
      We know where the music's playin' <br />
      Let's go out and feel the night <br />
<br>
      Because I'm still in love with you <br />
      I want to see you dance again <br />
      Because I'm still in love with you <br />
      On this harvest moon <br />
    </p>
