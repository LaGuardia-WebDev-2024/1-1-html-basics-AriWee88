    <h1>First half of "Harvest Moon"</h1>
    
    <h2>by Neil Young</h2>

    <h3>Lyrics:</h3>

    <p>
      Come a little bit <strong><em>closer</em></strong> <br />
      Hear what I have to say <br />
      Just like children <em>sleepin</em><br />
      We could dream this night away<br />
<br>
      But there's a full moon <strong><em>risin'</em></strong><br />
      Let's go dancin' in the light <br />
      We know where the music's <em>playin'</em> <br />
      Let's go out and feel the night <br />
<br>
      <strong>Because I'm still in love with you</strong> <br />
      I want to see you dance again <br />
      Because I'm still in love with you <br />
      <em><strong>On</strong> this <strong>harvest moon</strong></em> <br />
    </p>
